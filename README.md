Technologies Used:
Python (programming language)
Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, NLTK, vectorization)
Email data set (import from Kaggle)
Features:
a) Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing email data for machine learning algorithms.
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from email content and metadata (e.g., presence of certain keywords, capital letters, sender information).
Machine Learning Model Training: Training a machine learning model on labeled email data (spam vs. ham). This typically involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, choosing a suitable algorithm, and evaluating its performance.
Spam Detection: Using the trained model to classify new incoming emails as spam or ham.
Benefits:

b) Improved Email Security: This system can help filter out spam emails, reducing the risk of phishing attacks, malware, and other security threats.
Enhanced User Experience: By filtering spam, users receive a cleaner inbox with more relevant emails.
Scalability and Adaptability: Machine learning models can continuously improve their accuracy as they are exposed to more data.
Target Audience:

This project is beneficial for anyone looking to improve their email security, including individuals, organizations, and email service providers.
